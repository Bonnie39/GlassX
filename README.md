# GlassXI
# DEVELOPMENT OF THIS FORK OF BORDERSKIN HAS NOT BEGUN YET! STAY TUNED FOR UPDATES!

GlassXI is a free portable software that aims to bring back elements of the Aero design from Windows Vista & 7 such as reflective materials and background blurs.

# Getting Started
You will need Visual Studio to work with the project, I use Visual Studio 2013 but I think previous versions can work too.
That's it, just open solution and build it

# Project History
GlassXI was originally developed by Mohamed Kamaly. I discovered this project while searching for a way to get Aero Glass back in Windows 10 and decided that since it was long-since abandoned, to take up the project and try to revive it myself.
